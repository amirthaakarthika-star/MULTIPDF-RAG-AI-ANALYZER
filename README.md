# 📄 MULTICLOUD RAG AI POWERED PDF INTELLIGENCE

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based PDF Analysis Chatbot designed to help users extract insights from one or multiple PDF documents using natural language queries.

Users can upload PDFs, ask context-aware questions, and receive accurate responses with source citations. The system improves answer reliability by retrieving relevant document chunks before generating responses.

### Key Technical Highlights

- **Multi-PDF Support:** Upload and analyze multiple PDF files simultaneously.
- **Semantic Search:** Uses embeddings and vector similarity search to retrieve relevant content.
- **Reduced Hallucinations:** Grounds responses using retrieved document context.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a smooth user experience.
- **Explainability:** Displays source citations and optional debug retrieval view.
- **Export Support:** Users can export answers as PDF.
